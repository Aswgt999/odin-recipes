    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Coquito is a creamy, tropical, Puerto Rican holiday drink with tons of coconut flavor. It's made with both evaporated and condensed milk, cream of coconut, spices, rum, and — in this version — egg yolks. It is always requested at my holiday gatherings. Sometimes I hide it in the fridge to keep for myself! Serve in glass cups and sprinkle with more cinnamon if desired.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks, beaten</li>

        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
